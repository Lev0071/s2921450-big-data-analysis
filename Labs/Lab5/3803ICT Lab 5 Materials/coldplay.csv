Coldplay,Another's Arms,/c/coldplay/anothers+arms_21079526.html,"Late night watching tv  
Used to be you here beside me  
Used to be your arms around me  
Your body on my body  
  
When the world means nothing to me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
When the pain just rips right through me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Late night watching tv  
Used to be you here beside me  
Is there someone there to reach me?  
Someone there to find me?  
  
When the pain just rips right through me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
And that's just torture to me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Pull yourself into me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
When the world means nothing to me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Got to pull you close into me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
Pull yourself right through me  
Another's arms, another's arms  
  
Late night watching tv  
Wish that you were here beside me  
Wish that your arms were around me  
Your body on my body

Coldplay,Daylight,/c/coldplay/daylight_20032625.html,"To my surprise, and my delight  
I saw sunrise, I saw sunlight  
I am nothing in the dark  
And the clouds burst to show daylight  
  
Ooh and the sun will shine  
Yeah on this heart of mine  
Ooh and I realize  
Who cannot live without  
Ooh come apart without  
It...  
  
On a hilltop, on a sky-rise  
Like a firstborn child  
And at full tilt, and in full flight  
Defeat darkness, breaking daylight  
  
Ooh and the sun will shine  
Yeah on this heart of mine  
Ooh and I realized  
Who cannot live without  
Ooh and come apart without  
Daylight

They say people go  
This particular diamond was extra special  
  
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know  
Still I see you celestial  
  
Like a lion you ran, goddess you rolled  
Like an eagle you circled in perfect purple  
  
So how come things move on?  
How come cars don't slow?  
When it feels like the end of my world  
When I should but I can't let you go  
  
But when I'm cold, cold  
When I'm cold, cold  
There's a light that you give me  
When I'm in shadow  
There's a feeling you give me, an everglow  
  
Like the brothers in blood, sisters who ride  
Yeah we swore on that night we'd be friends till we died  
But the changing of winds and the way waters flow  
Life as short as the falling snow  
Now I'm going to miss you, I know  
  
But when I'm cold, cold  
In water rolled, salt  
I know that you're with me, and the way you will show  
And you're with me wherever I go  
And you give me this feeling, this everglow  
  
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold  
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow  
  
So if you love someone you should let them know  
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow

Until Monday morning feels another life  
I turn the music up  
I'm on a roll this time  
And heaven is in sight  
  
I turn the music up, I got my records on  
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song  
Don't want to see another generation drop  
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop  
  
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees  
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes  
But my heart is beating and my pulses start  
Cathedrals in my heart  
  
As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into  
To tell me it's alright  
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony  
And every tear's a waterfall  
Is a waterfall  
Oh

Oh oh oh  
Is a is a waterfall  
Every tear

And I know it's over, a parting of ways  
And it's done

Don't say it was all a waste  
Didn't we have fun?  
  
From the top of the world, the top of the waves  
We said forever, forever always  
  
We could have been lost, we would have been saved  
Now we're stopping the world, stopping it's spin  
Come on don't give up, don't say we give in  
Don't say it's over, don't say we're done

If no one ever hears?  
Every time I try to pull you close  
You disappear  
  
Maybe I'm a ghost  
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke  
A secret that nobody knows  
No one will ever hear

A specter on a roller coaster  
A thorn without a rose  
Just something people fear

It's all become clear  
What's the point of feeling love for you  
When you don't believe I'm here?

You disappear  
Every time I try to pull you close

Inside a glass of water  
With ripples and the rhymes

Oh that is just the way it was,  
And nothing could be better,  
And nothing ever was.

Cling to the mast  
Spend your whole life living in the past  
Going nowhere fast

Is no halo at all  
And Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders  
Saying nothing at all  
And you chime  
Stars in heaven align  
Oh

Neither how full nor empty is your glass,  
Cling to the mast  
Spend your whole life living in the past  
Going nowhere fast

To melt into this lake

Reflect what I am  
A loser and a winner  
The King of Siam  
And my Siamese twin

When I past by all the people say  
Just another guy on the lost highway  
  
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine  
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine  
On the day we met, oh I went astray  
I started rolling down that lost highway  
  
I was just a lad, nearly twenty two  
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you  
And now I'm lost, too late to pray  
Lord I paid a cost, on the lost highway  
  
Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round  
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound  
Take my advice or you'll curse the day  
You started rollin' down that lost highway  
You started rollin' down that lost highway  
You started rollin' down that lost highway  
You started rollin' down that lost highway

One day, we are gonna get out  
  
Tonight maybe we're gonna run

And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

When she saw those city lights  
She said the prettiest place on earth was  
Baltimore at night  
Well a man feels proud to give his woman  
What she's longing for  
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore  
  
Then I got myself a factory job  
I ran an old machine  
And I bought a little cottage  
In a neighborhood serene  
And every night when I'd come home  
With every muscle sore  
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore  
  
Well I did my best to bring her back  
To what she used to be  
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights  
More than she loved me  
Now I'm a going back on that same train  
That brought me here before

And the saints go marching in

My drunken as a Daniel in a lion's den  
And tonight I know it all has to begin again  
So whatever you do, don't let go  
  
And if we could float away  
Fly up to the surface and just start again  
And lift off before trouble  
Just erodes us in the rain  
  
Just erodes us in the rain  
Just erodes us and see roses  
In the rain

There was snow  
White snow  
  
Clearly I remember  
From the windows they were watching  
While we froze down below  
  
When the future's architectured  
By a carnival of idiots on show  
You'd better lie low  
  
[Chorus]  
If you love me  
Won't you let me know?  
  
Was a long and dark December  
When the banks became cathedrals  
And the fox  
Became God  
  
Priests clutched onto bibles  
Hollowed out to fit their rifles  
And the cross was held aloft  
  
Bury me in armour  
When I'm dead and hit the ground  
My nerves are poles that unfold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't want to be a soldier  
With the captain of some sinking ship  
Would stow, far below  
  
So if you love me  
Why'd you let me go?  
  
I took my love down to violet hill  
There we sat in snow  
All the time she was silent and still

I used to roll the dice

Listen as the crowd would sing  
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""  
  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
And I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
Once you go there was never, never an honest word  
That was when I ruled the world  
  
It was a wicked and wild wind  
Blew down the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I'd become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my head on a silver plate  
Just a puppet on a lonely string  
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing  
Roman Calvary choirs are singing  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

Find you never had to stop

Those heavenly regrets  
Still on me though  
Trying to catch a cannonball  
And so burning tired  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh through my veins is flowing  
From a shipwreck I heard a call  
Well she said  
  
When you're tired of aiming your arrows  
Still you'll never hit the mark  
Oh-oh-oh even if your aims are shadows  
Still we never gonna part  
  
Come on baby don't let it  
Break your heart  
Don't let it break your heart  
Don't let it break your heart

But maybe it's the perfect day  
Even though the bills are piling  
And maybe Lady Luck ain't smiling

We'd see the blessings in disguise  
That all the rain clouds are fountains  
Though our troubles seem like mountains  
  
There's gold in them hills

So don't lose heart  
Give the day a chance to start  
  
Every now and then life says  
Where do you think you're going so fast  
We're apt to think it cruel but sometimes  
It's a case of cruel to be kind  
  
And if we'd get up off our knees  
Why then we'd see the forest for the trees  
And we'd see the new sun rising  
Over the hills on the horizon  
  
There's gold in them hills  
There's gold in them hills  
So don't lose faith  
Give the world a chance to say...  
  
A word or two, my friend  
There's no telling how the day might end  
And we'll never know until we see  
That there's gold in them hills  
  
There's gold in them hills  
So don't lose heart  
Give the day a chance to start  
  
There's gold in them hills...

In a long black trench coat,  
Two hands around the throat,  
Ooh you want to get it right sometimes  
  
There's so much to be scared of,  
And not much to make sense of,  
How did the clowns ever get control?  
If your hear can you let me know,  
How can they invade it, when it's so complicated?  
Ooh you just want to get it right sometimes  
You just want to get it right sometimes

How many times can you say, you can't believe what you learn,  
That's how you see the world, don't you worry yourself,  
You're not gonna give up.  
  
And there's something missing, seems like there's nobody listening,
