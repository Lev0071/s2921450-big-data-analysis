There is no such thing as a "good" oil spill. If the time and place are just right, even a small oil spill can cause damage to sensitive ecosystems. Further, spills can cause harm days, months, years, or even decades after they occur. Because of this, spills are usually broken into short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) effects. Both of these types of harm must be addressed in ecosystem recovery: a controversial tactic that is often implemented immediately following an oil spill.
