Thomas Kuhn asserts that scientific research "is predicated on the assumption that the scientific community knows what the world is like" (5). Because this assumption is the foundation of most scientific knowledge, scientists are willing to go to great lengths to defend it, even to the point of suppressing substantial new information that would undermine the basic proposition (Kuhn 5).
